# CAR_PARKING
The parking code is a software application that automates the process of paying for car parking fees. It works by integrating with an API that provides information about the number plate of the parked car. This information is then used to determine the parking fee that the car owner needs to pay.

Once the fee has been calculated, the code allows Safaricom to display a payment prompt to the car owner. The payment prompt will provide the car owner with an option to pay the parking fee using their Safaricom account. The payment process will be secure and will be carried out in real-time, ensuring that the payment is received by the relevant authorities promptly.

The code is designed to make the process of paying for parking fees more efficient and convenient. By automating the payment process, it eliminates the need for the car owner to search for a parking meter or attend to a parking attendant, saving time and effort. Additionally, the integration with the API allows the code to keep track of the parking fee in real-time, ensuring that the fee remains accurate and up-to-date.

In summary, the parking code uses the number plate information obtained from the API to automate the process of paying for car parking fees. The code integrates with Safaricom to provide a secure and convenient payment solution, making the process of paying for parking more efficient and effortless.
